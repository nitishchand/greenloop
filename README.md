# Breathe-and-Build (BnB)

A **spec-to-verified-app system** for Claude Code: an npx installer + plugin that takes you from
an idea to a working, E2E-verified app through human-gated planning phases ("breathe") and a
machine-gated build loop ("build"). Every feature must survive a committed, tamper-evident
verifier — typecheck + unit + real E2E on a simulator — before the agent is allowed to stop.

> **Status: v1 feature-complete, pre-release.** Core engine, Claude Code plugin, the
> `expo-react-native` profile, guided installer, and the MiniClinic demo are implemented;
> not yet published to npm, and the full dogfood loop awaits its first provisioned CI run.
> Design spec: [`docs/specs/2026-07-08-breathe-and-build-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-07-08-breathe-and-build-design.md).

## Install

```bash
npx breathe-and-build          # guided: preflight loop, plugin + Expo MCP registration
npx breathe-and-build --check  # report-only preflight (exit 0 ready / 3 not ready)
npx breathe-and-build --yes    # auto-confirm the safe installs (Maestro)
```

The installer never half-installs: it auto-installs only Maestro, prints exact instructions
for everything else (Xcode, Docker Desktop), and re-checks in a loop until green.

## CLIs

All commands run in the *target project* directory (the app being built) and read
`bnb.config.json` + `progress.json` from its root.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bnb-verify <task-id>` | The green gate: typecheck → unit → env preflight → E2E, fail-fast. Sole writer of `passes` in `progress.json`. |
| `bnb-doctor` | Runs every environment check from config, prints the full ✓/✗ fix-it list. |
| `bnb-loop <task-id> [max-laps]` | Headless laps: runs `claude -p` with the boss prompt, gates each lap on `bnb-verify`. Wrap in `timeout 30m ...` for unattended runs. |
| `bnb-stop-hook` | Claude Code Stop hook: blocks the session from stopping while an active task is red (exit 2). Escape hatch: set `"abandoned": true` on the task. |

## Exit-code contract

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Green — all layers passed (`passes: true` written) |
| `1` | Red — a real failure (`passes: false` written); only the failing tail is printed, full logs in `.bnb/results/<task>/` |
| `3` | Environment not ready (preflight/doctor failure) — **not** a code failure; `passes` untouched |
| `9` | Usage error / unknown task |

## `bnb.config.json`

```json
{
  "profile": "expo-react-native",
  "resultsDir": ".bnb/results",
  "tailLines": 40,
  "verifier": {
    "typecheck": [{ "name": "mobile-tsc", "run": "npm run typecheck -w apps/mobile" }],
    "unit": [{ "name": "mobile-jest", "run": "npm test -w apps/mobile" }],
    "preflight": [{ "name": "backend-up", "run": "curl -sf http://localhost:3001/health", "fixHint": "docker compose up -d" }],
    "e2e": { "adapter": "maestro-ios", "run": "maestro test {flow}" }
  },
  "doctor": [
    { "name": "docker", "run": "docker info", "fixHint": "Start Docker Desktop" }
  ],
  "loop": {
    "allowedTools": "Read,Edit,Write,Bash(bnb-verify:*),Bash(npm test:*),Bash(npm run typecheck:*),Bash(maestro test:*),Bash(maestro hierarchy:*)",
    "maxTurns": 40
  }
}
```

`{flow}` in `e2e.run` is replaced by the task's `flow` path from `progress.json`.

## `progress.json`

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "s01-login",
      "spec": "Login screen per PRD S-01",
      "acceptance": ["user can log in with phone+PIN"],
      "testIDs": ["login-screen", "phone-input"],
      "flow": ".maestro/s01-login.yaml",
      "active": true,
      "passes": false,
      "abandoned": false,
      "reflexions": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules the whole system depends on:

- **`bnb-verify` is the only writer of `passes`.** Agents and humans never hand-set it.
- `active: true` arms the Stop hook; an active, non-passing, non-abandoned task blocks the
  Claude Code session from stopping.
- Weakening the verifier config or an E2E flow to force a pass is reward hacking; both are
  committed, so tampering shows in the diff.

## The plugin

The Claude Code plugin lives in [`plugin/`](plugin/) (plugin name: `bnb`). Until the guided
installer (Plan 4) lands, install it from this repo:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/breathe-and-build   # or the GitHub repo once public
claude plugin install bnb@breathe-and-build
```

### Commands

| Command | Phase | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `/bnb` | Status router — "You are in \<phase\>. Next: …" | — |
| `/bnb:idea` | Free-form conversation → drafts `prd.md` v0 | User confirms direction |
| `/bnb:prd` | Gap-hunting iteration loop on the PRD | Zero gaps **and** user declares final |
| `/bnb:architecture` | Schema / API / offline-sync review + stack confirmation | User approves |
| `/bnb:scaffold` | Births the project from the bound profile + artifacts | User reviews scaffold, fills `spiritual-guide.md` |
| `/bnb:feature <id>` | The green loop | Machine: `bnb-verify` exit 0, then review + commit |
| `/bnb:overnight <ids>` | Unattended `bnb-loop` runs | Wake-up ritual: diff review + fresh `bnb-verify` |
| `/bnb:doctor` | Environment fix-it list via `bnb-doctor` | — |

### Skills, hook, templates

- **Skills** (self-contained, no external plugin dependencies): `bnb-prd`,
  `bnb-architecture`, `bnb-feature`, `bnb-debugging`, `bnb-overnight`.
- **Stop hook**: `plugin/hooks/verify-before-stop.js` blocks the session from stopping while
  an active task is red. It is a self-contained copy of `bnb-stop-hook` (a marketplace
  install only ships `plugin/`), kept identical by a parity test.
- **Templates** (`plugin/templates/`): the §5 artifact set — `prd.md` (S-NN screen specs
  with required testIDs), `state.md`, `debug.md`, `progress.json`, `spiritual-guide.md`,
  `remaining-tasks.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

## Stack profiles

Swapping stacks swaps more than the E2E command, so the unit of extension is a **profile**
(`profiles/<name>/`), not a verifier adapter:

| File | Consumed by |
|---|---|
| `verifier.json` | `bnb-verify` — layer commands + e2e adapter |
| `doctor.json` | `bnb-doctor` — required tools + env checks |
| `toolbelt.md` | the build-loop skills — launch, logs, screenshots, view tree |
| `conventions.md` | the build-loop skills — testID naming, flow locations, idioms |
| `templates/` | `/bnb:scaffold` — the project scaffold |

A project binds a profile in `bnb.config.json` (`"profile": "expo-react-native"`).
`loadConfig` merges the profile's `verifier`/`doctor` defaults under the project's config;
**a key present in the project config replaces the profile's key wholesale** (no deep
merging), and an unknown profile name is a hard error — no silent degradation.

v1 ships `profiles/expo-react-native` (macOS + iOS Simulator): Expo + expo-router +
WatermelonDB + Zustand + TanStack Query / Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL + Redis /
npm-workspaces monorepo / Maestro E2E. Template dependency versions get exercised and
pinned by the MiniClinic demo + CI (Plan 4).
