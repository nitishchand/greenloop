# Breathe-and-Build — Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-07-08
**Repo:** `/Users/nitishchand/codebase/breathe-and-build` (local only — no GitHub remote yet)

## What is this

Open-source spec-to-verified-app system for Claude Code (npx installer + plugin), codifying the
ClinicBuddy build methodology. Design spec: `docs/specs/2026-07-08-breathe-and-build-design.md`
(approved). Implementation split into 4 plans; plan docs live in `docs/plans/`.

## Status by plan

- ✅ **Plan 1 — Core engine** (`docs/plans/2026-07-08-01-core-engine.md`, merged to main 2026-07-08):
  zero-dep Node ESM package, 27 tests green (`npm test`).
  CLIs: `bnb-verify` (green gate, exit 0/1/3/9, sole writer of `passes`), `bnb-doctor`
  (fix-it list, exit 0/3), `bnb-loop` (headless laps via `claude -p`), `bnb-stop-hook`
  (blocks stop while active task red; escape = `abandoned:true`).
  Contracts documented in README.md — Plans 2–4 build on them; do not change without care.
- ✅ **Plan 2 — Plugin** (`docs/plans/2026-07-08-02-plugin.md`, merged to main 2026-07-08):
  plugin name `bnb` (`plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), repo-root marketplace
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, install: `claude plugin install bnb@breathe-and-build`),
  8 flat commands in `plugin/commands/` (`/bnb` router + idea/prd/architecture/scaffold/
  feature/overnight/doctor), 5 skills, 7 artifact templates, self-contained Stop hook
  (`plugin/hooks/verify-before-stop.js`, parity-tested vs `bnb-stop-hook`). 54 tests green;
  `claude plugin validate` clean. Resolved spec §15 Q1 (packaging) + Q3 (spiritual-guide
  prompts). NOTE: skill/command frontmatter descriptions with a colon must be quoted
  (YAML) — guarded by test.
- ✅ **Plan 3 — expo-react-native profile** (`docs/plans/2026-07-08-03-expo-react-native-profile.md`,
  merged to main 2026-07-08): `profiles/expo-react-native/` — verifier.json (tsc→jest→maestro
  + backend/simulator/metro preflights), doctor.json (7 checks incl. accessibility reminder),
  toolbelt.md, conventions.md, scaffold templates (Expo+Express+Prisma npm-workspaces monorepo,
  docker-compose ×3 `unless-stopped`, curated allowlist settings.json). `loadConfig` now merges
  profile verifier/doctor under project overrides (project key wins WHOLESALE; unknown profile
  throws). Template dep versions unverified until MiniClinic runs (Plan 4).
- ✅ **Plan 4 — Installer + MiniClinic + CI + docs** (`docs/plans/2026-07-08-04-installer-demo-ci-docs.md`,
  merged to main 2026-07-08): scaffold engine (`src/core/scaffold.js`, `{{VAR}}` substitution,
  never overwrites), `npx breathe-and-build` installer (preflight loop, only Maestro
  auto-installs, `--check`/`--yes`, registers plugin + Expo MCP), `demo/miniclinic`
  (scaffold + 2 screens + patients endpoint + flow; no-drift test vs templates),
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (unit gate ubuntu+macos × node 20/22; dogfood job
  dispatch-only), docs set (tutorial/playbook/os-matrix/writing-profiles/container-mode).
  Resolved spec §15 Q2: Metro MCP folds into Expo MCP (`claude mcp add --transport http
  expo https://mcp.expo.dev/mcp` + `expo-mcp` dev dep + `EXPO_UNSTABLE_MCP_SERVER=1`);
  Fetch MCP dropped (built-in WebFetch). 95 tests green.

## v1 status — feature-complete, pre-release

All four plans merged. Remaining steps are human/external:

1. Create the GitHub repo (`nitishchand/breathe-and-build`) and push — unlocks the CI unit
   gate and makes the marketplace installable by URL.
2. `npm publish` — makes `npx breathe-and-build@latest` real.
3. First provisioned dogfood run (macOS + Xcode + Maestro + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY): dispatch the
   CI `dogfood` job or run it locally against `demo/miniclinic`; pins the profile template
   dependency versions (currently best-known, unexecuted) and, per spec §12, the tutorial
   should be regenerated from that run.

## Conventions

- Plain Node >= 20 ESM, zero runtime deps, `node --test` (no jest). No build step.
- Pure logic in `src/` with injectable `exec`/`log`; `bin/` are thin wrappers. TDD per plan docs.
- Work on a `plan-N-*` branch, merge to main when green.
- `bossPrompt()` in `src/core/loop.js` is exported for Plan 2's overnight skill to reuse.
